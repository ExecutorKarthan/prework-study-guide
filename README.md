## Description

This project was designed to produce a reference guide for me to use in an upcoming course to become a web developer. I built this to introduce myself to the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Git and GitHub. This provided me with a guided tutorial on how these technologies worked and how to successfully implement them to produce a webpage. 

I learned quite a bit, particularly about Git and GitHub. I did not know the Git commandline commands, which were used frequently in this project, as well as I did not fully understand GitHub's workflow. Since I had to use both of those technologies on a frequent basis, I now understand clearly how these technologies are used for version control.

I knew very little about HTML and CSS, but was happy to practice them through this project. HTML was something I had read about and feel reinforced on how it works by doing this project. I have a much better understanding of the role that CSS has for HTML pages, as well how to link CSS formatting to a webpage. That was not clear from my prior readings. 

## Installation

## Usage

This guide contains my abbreviated notes on the following topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git/GitHub. It also contains an example script that can be viewed in the console of a web browser after inspection. Each section organizes my notes by topic so they can be easily referenced if I have future questions about the technologies in the future. The notes are focused on things that I either did not know prior to this project or concepts that I found interesting during this project.
